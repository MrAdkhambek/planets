The moon is the easiest celestial object to find in the night sky — when it's there. Earth's only natural satellite hovers above us bright and round until it seemingly disappears for a few nights. The rhythm of the moon's phases has guided humanity for millennia — for instance, calendar months are roughly equal to the time it takes to go from one full moon to the next.

Moon phases and the moon's orbit are mysteries to many. For example, the moon always shows us the same face. That happens because it takes 27.3 days both to rotate on its axis  _and_  to orbit Earth. We see either the full moon, half moon or no moon (new moon) because the moon reflects sunlight. How much of it we see depends on the moon's position in relation to Earth and the sun.

Though a satellite of Earth, the moon, with a diameter of about 2,159 miles (3,475 kilometers), is bigger than Pluto. (Four other moons in our solar system are even bigger.) The moon is a bit more than one-fourth (27 percent) the size of Earth, a much smaller ratio (1:4) than any other planets and their moons. This means the moon has a great effect on the planet and very possibly is what makes life on Earth possible.

## Facts about the Moon

-   **There is no dark side of the Moon.**  Both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight, however because the Moon is tidally locked to Earth, only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around its axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit Earth. The side we see from Earth is reflected by sunlight, while the “dark” side has only been seen by the human eye from a spacecraft and lies in darkness.
-   **The rise of fall of tides on Earth is caused by the Moon.**  Two bulges exist due to the gravitational pull the Moon exerts. One is on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side facing away from it. These bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates which causes the high and low tides found across the globe.
-   **The Moon is slowly drifting away from Earth.**  Every year, the Moon moves roughly 3.8 cm further away from Earth. Scientific estimates suggest this will continue to happen for 50 billion years. At that point, the Moon will take 47 days to orbit the Earth, compared to the current time of 27.3 days.
-   **You weigh much less on the Moon.**  A common fact about the Moon is that it has much weaker gravity than Earth’s gravity. This is because its smaller mass and you would weight one sixth (about 16.5%) of your Earth weight while on the Moon.
-   **Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon.**  It started with Neil Armstrong in 1969 as part of the Apollo 11 mission moon landing and ended with Gene Cernan in 1972 on the Apollo 17 mission. A total of 12 American males have walked on the Moon. Since 1972, all lunar missions have been unmanned spacecraft.
-   **The Moon will be visited by man again.**  NASA space agency has plans to set up a permanent space station on the Moon for further lunar exploration, and man may walk on the Moon again sometime around 2020-21.
-   **The USA considered detonating a nuclear bomb on the Moon in the 50s.**  A secret project during the height of the cold war – codenamed “Project A119”, also known as “A Study of Lunar Research Flights” was planned as a “show of strength” for the United States at a time when they were falling behind the USSR in the space race.
-   **There is no atmosphere on the Moon.**  There is no protection for the lunar surface from cosmic rays, meteorites, asteroids, comets, or solar winds. This is why the Moon has such huge temperature variations and it is covered with impact lunar craters. The lack of atmosphere also means no sound can be heard on the Moon and the sky is always black.
-   **The Moon has quakes.**  The gravitational pull of Earth causes small moonquakes several kilometres beneath the surface of the moon – causing ruptures and cracks. It is believed that, like Earth, the Moon has a molten core.
-   **The Moon is the fifth largest natural satellite.**  It is much smaller than the major moons of Saturn and Jupiter at 3,475 km in diameter, but the Moon is the largest in relation to the size of the planet it orbits. Earth is about 80 times the volume of the Moon, yet they are the same age. A popular theory is that the Moon was once part of the Earth and formed from a chunk broken off by a huge object that collided with Earth while it was still young.
-   **The “Man in the Moon” is an optical illusion**  seen when looking at the Moon’s surface from Earth. It is a result of the contrast between the lighter lunar highlands and darker lunar plains.
-   **The diameter of the Moon is the same distance from New York City to Phoenix, Arizona.**
-   **There are over 500,000 craters**  on the Moon’s surface.
-   **A lunar eclipse is when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon**  and a shadow is cast on the Moon.
-   **A solar eclipse is when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth**  – causing a shadow to project onto the Earth’s surface.
