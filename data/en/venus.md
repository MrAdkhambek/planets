The second planet from the sun, Venus is Earth's twin in size. Radar images beneath its atmosphere reveal that its surface has various mountains and volcanoes. But beyond that, the two planets couldn't be more different. Because of its thick, toxic atmosphere that's made of sulfuric acid clouds, Venus is an extreme example of the greenhouse effect. It's scorching-hot, even hotter than Mercury. The average temperature on Venus' surface is 900 F (465 C). At 92 bar, the pressure at the surface would crush and kill you. And oddly, Venus spins slowly from east to west, the opposite direction of most of the other planets.

The Greeks believed Venus was two different objects â€” one in the morning sky and another in the evening. Because it is often brighter than any other object in the sky, Venus has generated many UFO reports.

## Facts about Venus
- **Venus and Earth are often called twins.** 
Because they are similar in size, mass, density, composition and gravity. The  [size of Venus](https://www.space.com/18530-how-big-is-venus.html)  is only a little smaller than our home planet, with a mass that's about 80% of Earth's.

- The interior of  [Venus is made of](https://www.space.com/18525-venus-composition.html)  a metallic iron core that's roughly 2,400 miles (6,000 km) wide. Venus' molten rocky mantle is roughly 1,200 miles (3,000 km) thick. Venus' crust is mostly basalt, and is estimated to be 6 to 12 miles (10 to 20 km) thick, on average.

- Venus is the hottest planet in the  [solar system](https://www.space.com/16080-solar-system-planets.html). Although Venus is not the planet closest to the sun, its dense atmosphere traps heat in a runaway version of the  [greenhouse effect](https://www.space.com/greenhouse-effect.html)  that warms Earth. As a result,  [temperatures on Venus](https://www.space.com/18526-venus-temperature.html)  reach 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius), which is more than hot enough to melt lead. Spacecraft have survived only a few hours after landing on the planet before being destroyed.

**Here are some of Venus' parameters, according to NASA:**

-   Average distance from the sun: 67,237,910 miles (108,208,930 km). By comparison: 0.723 times that of Earth.
-   Perihelion (closest approach to sun): 66,782,000 miles (107,476,000 km). By comparison: 0.730 times that of Earth.
-   Aphelion (farthest distance from sun): 67,693,000 miles (108,942,000 km). By comparison: 0.716 times that of Earth.
