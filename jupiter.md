<p>The fifth planet from the sun, Jupiter is a giant gas world that is the most massive planet in our solar system â€” more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined, <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/jupiter/overview/">according to NASA</a>. Its swirling clouds are colorful due to different types of trace gases. And a major feature in its swirling clouds is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm more than 10,000 miles wide. It has raged at more than 400 mph for the last 150 years, at least. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, and with 75 moons, it looks a bit like a miniature solar system.</p>
